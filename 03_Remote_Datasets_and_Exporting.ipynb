    "Most Earth-science agencies openly and freely disseminate satellite, model, and in situ observations. Typically, data are stored in online data repositories and data holdings can be queried and ordered. Some examples are shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NASA](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data)\n",

    "\n",
    "### OPeNDAP/THREDDS catalogs\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasingly agencies are offering data catalogs that allow users to directly read from the archive without ordered. Open-source Project for a [Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP)](https://www.opendap.org/) is an example of a software tool that simplifies access. Instead of downloading and reading data into Python, we can access it directly using a URL. Xarray supports OPeNDAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a couple of useful data OPeNDAP catalogs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [NOAA/Physical Sciences Lab](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/) gridded climate datasets extending hundreds of years to real-time wind profiler data at a single location. The data or products derived from this data, organized by type, are available to scientists and the general public at the links below.\n",
    "* [NASA EOSDIS OpeNDAP Servers](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/engage/open-data-services-and-software/api/opendap/opendap-servers) servers across the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). Contains many NASA satellite and reanalysis datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows Level 3 Monthly Average Chlorophyll Concentration from the Ocean Biology Processing Group (NASA/GSFC/OBPG). As you can see, we are passing a url and not a file location into xarray. One caveat if the engine **must be netcdf4** because the h5netcdf engine presently doesn't support opendap."

    "## Scripting with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python scripts from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are finished editing the code and you probably want to run it. There are two ways you can run Python scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the command line interpreter\n",
    "2. Using iPython\n",
    "\n",
    "iPython is an interactive command line that allows you to run code in chunks. In fact, Jupyter Notebook is built using iPython, which explains the similarity in behavior.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Windows: I suggest using the Anaconda Prompt which you can access from the start menu or using Anaconda Navigator. \n",
    "* MacOs/Linux: open the Terminal app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the command line is open, you start in a default location. For example, if you are using Windows and launch the Anaconda Prompt you will see:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(base) C:\\Users\\>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, navigate to where our script is. To do this, you will change directories using the cd command. For example, if your code is stored in C:\\Documents\\Python, you can type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "cd C:\\Documents\\Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line will now be updated showing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(base) C:\\Documents\\Python>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are in the right place, you can call the Python interpreter, which to convert your code into a format that your computer can understand and executes the command. If you installed Anaconda, this includes a Python 3 interpreter (*python3*). So, to run the script, type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 hello_world.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If successful, “Hello Earth” should print to your screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second method is to use iPython, which allows you to open Python in interactive mode. Unlike the command line method, iPython will let you run code line-by-line. So, like Jupyter Notebook, you have the option to copy and paste you code from the text editor in chunks into the iPython window. You can also call the entire script inside iPython. This is done by starting iPython and using the command %run \\[script name\\].py. Below is a capture from my terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 20:23:39) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\n",
    "Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\n",
    "IPython 7.12.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1]: %run script_example.ipynb\n",
    "Hello Earth\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of using iPython is that after the script finishes running, variables that were generated in the script are still in memory. Then, you can print or operate on the variables to either debug or to develop your code further. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noted two differences in workflow for write code in scripts versus notebooks, (1) that code cannot be inline and (2) the program must run fully to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling output when scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous example, you printed text to the screen but Python’s capable of saving figures and data. To save plots, replace *plt.show()* with the *plt.savefig()* command.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to directly display your graphics using the X11 protocol (by default in Linux) with XQuartz (Mac) or PuTTy (Windows). \n",
    "\n",
    "I typically discourage this because satellite imagery tends to be very large and thus slow to display remotely. From my experience, it is usually faster to write an image to a file and then view the plot after it is fully rendered.\n",
