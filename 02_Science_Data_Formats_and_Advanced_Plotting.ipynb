    "NetCDF and HDF are self-describing formats, which are structured binary data files and useful for storing other big datasets. Computationally, it is faster to read in binary-based datasets than text, which needs to be parsed before being stored into a computerâ€™s memory. Because the files are more compact, they are cheaper to store large, long-term satellite data. Furthermore, information about the data (\"metadata\") can be stored inside the file themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets:\n",
    "* JRR-AOD_v2r3_j01_s202009152044026_e202009152045271_c202009152113150_thinned.nc: A netCDF file that contains Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) retrieved from a Suomi NPP overpass on 2020 9 Aug.  For this workshop, unused fields were removed.\n",
    "* gfs_3_20200915_0000_000.grb2: A GRIB2 file that contains GFS analysis\n",
    "* MOP03JM-201811-L3V95.6.3_thinned.nc: The Nov 2018 CO monthly mean from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), which is an instrument on the Terra satellite.\n",
    "    * NOTE: For this tutorial, the file was converted to a netCDF4 file and unused variable fields were removed. The original file is HDF5 MOP03JM-201811-L3V95.6.3.he5 and can be obtained from https://earthdata.nasa.gov/.\n",

However, mesh plots do not perform any smoothing and display data as-is on a regular grid. However, since many satellite datasets are swath-based, irregularly spaced data needs to be re-gridded in order to display it as a mesh grid. In the code block below, letâ€™s compare how the sst data looks using pcolormesh command with the previous example using contour.

Furthermore, Cartopy also enables you to convert your data from one map projection to another, which requires a cartesian coordinate system to the map coordinates. Matplotlib natively supports the six mathematical and map projections (Aitoff, Hammer, Lambert, Mollweide, polar, and rectilinear) and combined with Cartopy, data can be transformed to a total of 33 possible projections."
